### Code of conduct

Participation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

## Versioning and releases

As of the `0.28.0` release, the apiserver-network-proxy project is changing its versioning and release
process. Going forward the project will adhere to these rules:

* This project follows semantic versioning (eg `x.y.z`) for releases and tags.
* Tags indicate readiness for a release, and project maintainers will create corresponding releases.
* Releases and tags align with the Kubernetes minor release versions (the `y` in `x.y.z`). For instance,
  if Kubernetes releases version `1.99.0`, the corresponding release and tag for apiserver-network-proxy will be
  `0.99.0`.
* Branches will be created when the minor release version (the `y` in `x.y.z`) is increased, and follow the
  pattern of `release-x.y`. For instance, if version `0.99.0` has been released, the corresponding branch
  will be named `release-0.99`.
* Patch level versions for releases and tags will be updated when patches are applied to the specific release
  branch. For example, if patches must be applied to the `release-0.99` branch and a new release is created,
  the version will be `0.99.1`. In this manner the patch level version number (the `z` in `x.y.z`) may not
  match the Kubernetes patch level.

For Kubernetes version `1.28.0+`, we recommend using the tag that corresponds to the same minor version
number. For example, if you are working with Kubernetes version `1.99`, please utilize the latest `0.99`
tag and refer to the `release-0.99` branch. It is important to note that there may be disparities in the
patch level between apiserver-network-proxy and Kubernetes.

For Kubernetes version `<=1.27`, it is recommended to match apiserver-network-proxy server & client
minor release versions. With Kubernetes, this means:

* Kubernetes versions v1.26 through v1.27: `0.1.X` tags, `release-0.1` branch.
* Kubernetes versions v1.23 through v1.25: `0.0.X` tags, `release-0.0` branch.
* Kubernetes versions up to v1.23: apiserver-network-proxy versions up to `v0.0.30`.
  Refer to the kubernetes go.mod file for the specific release version.

## Build

Please make sure you have the REGISTRY and PROJECT_ID environment variables set.
For local builds these can be set to anything.
For image builds these determine the location of your image.
For GCE the registry should be gcr.io and PROJECT_ID should be the project you
want to use the images in.
Please ensure the go bin directory (usually `~/go/bin`) is in your `PATH`.

### Mockgen

The [```mockgen```](https://github.com/uber-go/mock) tool must be installed on your system.

Currently, we are using go.uber.org/mock/mockgen@v0.5.2

`go install go.uber.org/mock/mockgen@v0.5.2`

### Protoc

Proto definitions are compiled with `protoc`. Please ensure you have protoc installed ([Instructions](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/)) and the `protoc-gen-go` and `protoc-gen-go-grpc` libraries at the appropriate version.

Currently, we are using protoc-gen-go@v1.27.1

`go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.27.1`

Currently, we are using protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.2

`go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.2`

### Local builds

```console
make clean
make certs
make gen
make build
```

### Build images

```console
make docker-build
```

## Examples

The current examples run two actual services as well as a sample client on one end and a sample destination for
requests on the other.
- *Proxy service:* The proxy service takes the API server requests and forwards them appropriately.
- *Agent service:* The agent service connects to the proxy and then allows traffic to be forwarded to it.

### Running on kubernetes
See following [README.md](examples/kubernetes/README.md)

### Running on a local kubernetes cluster with `kind`
See this [README.md](examples/kind/README.md) for an example that creates a local kubernetes cluster using` kind` and
deploys the proxy agent on a worker node and the proxy server on a control plane node.

See this [README.md](examples/kind-multinode/README.md) for a similar example that creates a `kind` cluster with a 
user-configurable number of control plane and worker nodes and optionally sideloads custom proxy agent and server images.

### Tutorials

See this [Set up Konnectivity service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/setup-konnectivity/) tutorial for
an example of the Konnectivity service providing a TCP level proxy for the control plane to cluster communication.

### Clients

`apiserver-network-proxy` components are intended to run as standalone binaries and should not be imported as a library. Clients communicating with the network proxy can import the `konnectivity-client` module.
